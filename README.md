Machine learning model capable of  classifying forests as either “fire likely” (1) or “fire unlikely” (0) in a particular time window 
based on details about the forest and surrounding land and air.  This was done by developing a logistic regression, decision tree and neural network models. 
Logistic regression was the best model and the modelling focused on optimizing for F1 to minimise false negatives.
